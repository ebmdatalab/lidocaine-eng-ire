## LIdocaine prescribing in England and Ireland

This repo contains the code to accompany our analyis on _[The impact of lidocaine plaster prescribing reduction strategies: A comparison of two national health services in Europe](https://doi.org/10.1111/bcp.15779)_ now published in the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology.

## How to view the notebooks

Notebooks live in the `notebooks/` folder (with an `ipynb`
extension). You can most easily view them [on
nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ebmdatalab/<repo>/tree/master/notebooks/),
though looking at them in Github should also work.

To do development work, you'll need to set up a local jupyter server
and git repository - see `DEVELOPERS.md` for more detail.
